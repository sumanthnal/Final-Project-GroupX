# First file to be run in the code file is the preprocessing.py file. This will generaet a train_set.csv, a test_set.csv, and a valid_set.csv

# These files are ingested by training.py for the classical machine learning techniques and by nn_training.py for the neural network techniques.

# Finally, the zero_shot.py file can be run on its own without any dependency. It is just meant to show the generation of predictions from the zero-shot approach.
